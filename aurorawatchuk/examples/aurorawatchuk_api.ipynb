The results are read in when the module first starts up, ensuring that calls to the ``aurorawatchuk`` module made by separate processes (e.g., jobs started from a `crontab` file) observe the minimum interval between requests. The cache directory is determined by ``appdirs.user_config_dir('aurorawatchuk')``. For applications where another location may be preferred (such as a `tmpfs` file system on the Raspberry Pi) then the location of the cache directory can be adjusted by a user config file.
